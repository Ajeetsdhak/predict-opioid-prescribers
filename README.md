# Use-DSX-and-Scikit-Learn-to-Predict-US-Opioid-Prescribers
A pattern focusing on how to use scikit learn and python (in DSX) to predict opioid prescribers based off of a 2014 kaggle dataset.

## Use Machine Learning to Predict US Opioid Prescribers with DSX and Scikit Learn

## Intro

Follow the template! After the title use a few sentences to say what the journey will do, mention key technologies and list goals.

## Architecture Image

![alt text](https://github.com/MadisonJMyers/Use-DSX-and-Scikit-Learn-to-Predict-US-Opioid-Prescribers/blob/master/docs/images/architecture.png)

## Flow

There is a **Flow** section, which is a numbered list that matches and explains the numbers in the architecture image.

## With Watson

Copy the **With Watson** section and use it as-is (unless you don't use Watson at all).

## Included components

Take component links and text from the [here](components.md).

## Featured technologies

Take technology links and text from the [here](technologies.md).

## Watch the Video

See the template or example journeys for how to include a link to your video with a preview. Say the YouTube video is at `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxi7U7VOMYg`, that means the video ID is `Jxi7U7VOMYg`. To generate a video preview, add the following snippet, replacing `Jxi7U7VOMYg` with the new video ID:  ``[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Jxi7U7VOMYg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Jxi7U7VOMYg)``

## Steps

Make sure the steps are complete, clear and accurate enough to get a developer through the journey! The template shows an example where we have a *Deploy to Bluemix* button and a *Run locally* option. Ideally we'll get a lot of consistency with these 2 options and this template, but it will vary.

* Use a numbered list for the steps and be sure to test the links.
* Do not be overly verbose or include screenshots for routine steps, like signing up for Bluemix, or creating a service in Bluemix. These are obvious and don't need more than a single sentence.
* Follow the example for linking to services (for manual service creation).
* Try to follow existing journey examples for consistency and help us improve our templates and examples too.

## Sample output

Use a final _Analyze the results_ or _Conclusion_ step above, plus sample output to wrap up the journey for a developer running it and also for people that are only going to read the README. Sample output format will vary depending on the journey technology used.

## Links

Find some interesting links for this list. Include a link to the video even though it is mentioned above.

## Troubleshooting

Please follow the example format or contribute templates or suggestions. Break out troubleshooting into it's own .MD file when the section gets long.
